<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>In order to remain lightweight, Anchor only supports recent versions of the languages it’s written in. So you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3.6+</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>mcrypt</li>
<li>gd</li>
<li>pdo_mysql or pdo_sqlite</li>
<li>MySQL 5.2+</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not sure what version of PHP you have, create a new file, and paste the following in at the top of the page:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ?php echo PHP_VERSION; // version.php</code></pre>
<p>This should print a number to your screen, which should exceed 5.3.6.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the necessary requirements, you will not be able to install Anchor. You should contact your host to upgrade.</p>
